This was a project I made my Sophmore year of College at MSU, in my Software Engineering class.

The goal of this project was using java, to create a grading calculator which you could navigate in the terminal. The project was required to create different categories, classes, and assignments to determine your grade,
as well as be able to save all necesssary data to a .csv file. 

This project was a big challange and took many hours of planning and programming, but I was very satisfied with the final product.
One of my personal goals for this project was to make the Grading Calculator visually appealing, despite being written in the terminal, which I accomplished using whitespace and | characters.
